* Sprint File Specification

** Naming

=YYYY-MM-DD sprint NN.org= — date is sprint start.

** Structure

Sprint files follow this section order:

#+begin_src org
,* Sprint N: Title

,** Plan

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

,** Focus

One sentence describing what this sprint is about.

,** Checkpoint

"Question that validates sprint success?"

,** Notes

,** Learnings and Insights

,** Closing Status
#+end_src

** Constraints

*** Plan section

- Flat list of tasks (no nesting, no sub-sections)
- Located at the top, immediately after the title
- Each task is a checkbox: =- [ ] Task description=
- Keep tasks concrete and actionable

*** Focus section

- One sentence or short paragraph
- Describes the sprint's primary objective

*** Checkpoint section

- Phrased as a question
- Answerable with yes/no at sprint end
- Validates whether the sprint achieved its goal

*** Notes section

- Technical notes discovered during sprint
- Can have sub-sections as needed
- Temporary capture — process during daily review

*** Learnings and Insights section

- What we learned during the sprint
- Can have sub-sections with dates
- Permanent record — important findings stay here

*** Weekly Review section (optional)

- Added after each Friday during longer sprints
- Answers the weekly checkpoint questions:
  1. What works now that didn't work Monday?
  2. What's the biggest obstacle for next week?
  3. Am I still excited about this?
  4. Does the original thesis still hold?

*** Closing Status section

- Filled at sprint end
- Contains: Outcome, What works, What needs improvement, Key insights, Stats
- Stats include: Started, Closed, Duration

** Sprint as Working Memory

The sprint file is working memory during a sprint:
- Flat task list for current sprint
- Capture insights/ideas as they come (messy is fine)
- Rework freely as reality changes
- Temporary — processed daily, archived at sprint end

** Daily Review (5-10 min)

At least once per day, or after significant learnings:
- Process sprint notes
- Move insights to permanent docs (methodology, decisions, etc.)
- Move ideas to idea backlog or decision backlog
- Cross off done items

Without the review step, sprint logs become graveyards of forgotten learnings.

** Lifecycle

1. Create sprint file with Plan, Focus, Checkpoint (empty other sections)
2. Work through tasks, add notes as discovered
3. Mark tasks done, capture learnings
4. Close sprint with Closing Status
5. Tag repos with =sprint-NN=

** Anti-patterns

- Nested task lists in Plan (use flat list)
- Multiple focus areas (one sprint = one focus)
- Vague checkpoints ("Did we make progress?")
- Forgetting to add Stats at closing
