* Sprint 1: Initial business-operations Structure

** Plan

- [ ] Create directory structure in business-operations repository
- [ ] Extract ADRs from b-ops docs/decisions/ (public-safe, no secrets)
- [ ] Extract Minisforum hardware configs from infrastructure/nixos/hardware/
- [ ] Create initial flake.nix exposing NixOS hardware modules
- [ ] Verify hardware modules work when imported from external flake

** Focus

Establish business-operations repository with first low-risk extractions to
validate the multi-repo approach.

** Checkpoint

"Can a NixOS configuration import hardware modules from business-operations?"

** Notes

** Learnings and Insights

** Closing Status
