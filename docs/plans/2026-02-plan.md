# February 2026: Make Current State Public

## Goal

Finish extracting the reusable platform from `b-ops` into
`business-operations` (public), with `demo-ops` as a working example
and automated tests proving the deployment pipeline works.

## Key Results

1. `demo-ops` can be deployed into a QEMU VM and produces a working
   single-node Kubernetes cluster (tested automatically)
2. `business-operations` contains all reusable NixOS modules, Ansible
   roles, and public documentation
3. `b-ops` is reduced to a thin private overlay (site-specific config
   and secrets only)
4. Documentation is published and accessible

## Big Steps

- [x] Foundation: set up `business-operations` with first NixOS modules
  and Ansible roles, `demo-ops` with working single-node k0s config
  (sprint 1)
- [x] Extract NixOS modules to `business-operations` (sprint 1)
- [ ] Testing foundation: pytest-based end-to-end tests for `demo-ops`
  against QEMU VMs (sprint 2)
- [ ] Flux/GitOps layer: experiment with multi-repo approaches, extract
  VolSync templates and base infrastructure patterns
- [ ] Extract and publish public documentation to `business-operations`
- [ ] Key generation and secrets handling: solid solution for `demo-ops`
- [ ] `demo-ops` fully functional: deploy, bootstrap, applications
- [ ] `b-ops` consuming `business-operations` for all infrastructure

## Backlog

Items not yet scheduled into a sprint. Review when creating new sprints.

- [ ] Extract public documentation to `business-operations`
- [ ] Build and publish documentation
- [ ] `demo-ops` and `b-ops` should be able to refer back to the
  documentation
- [ ] Experiment: explore multi-repo approaches for Flux/Kustomize layer
- [ ] Experiment: try out most promising approaches with VolSync
  templates
- [ ] Experiment: explore Taskfile pattern for cluster tasks (push to
  internal Gitea)
- [ ] Review: key generation and handling in `demo-ops` needs a more
  solid solution
- [ ] Review: development across repositories would benefit from
  something like a "dev install", flakes don't seem to support this
  out of the box
- [ ] Review: flakes can provide templates, maybe a template could be
  provided to create an instance of the setup? Check if templates
  also support updating like copier does.
- [ ] Document known limitations
- [ ] Update secrets handling documentation when working on `demo-ops`
- [ ] Consider submitting hardware modules to nixos-hardware
- [ ] Document WOL/shutdown task pattern for cluster management
- [ ] Document cluster task patterns (push, info, forward-gitea)
- [ ] Remove unused tasks from `b-ops` (trigger-backup, k3s-*,
  bootstrap)
- [ ] Create Renovate configuration for `business-operations` (GitHub)
- [ ] Improve key generation handling in ~demo-ops~ (pulled from backlog)
