# Decision Backlog

Decisions that need to be made eventually, but not now.

Each file captures:
- Context: Why this decision matters
- Options: What we're choosing between
- Current thinking: Most likely approach
- Decision trigger: When to decide

## Naming Convention

`<category>-<keywords>.md`

Categories: architecture, process, tooling, scope

## Workflow

1. Discover decision needed
2. Create file with context and options
3. Forget about it (system remembers)
4. Revisit when trigger condition met
5. Create ADR in `decisions/`
6. Move file to decided list or delete
